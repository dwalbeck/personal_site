One Vision Beyond

Owner / Operator

10/1998 – present
In each contract project I would meet with the key people and clearly define the goals and complete feature functionality, as well as discuss technology options available and recommendations. Over the years there has been times when this was my full time job, but mostly it has been on the side when availability allows.  Every job has been 100% referral, as I don't advertise or even claim this to be a business.

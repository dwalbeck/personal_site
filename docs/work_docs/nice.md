Analyzed architectural weaknesses contributing to system instability and outlined corrective strategies. Rewrote core components, stabilized services, and enhanced modularity. Delivered Docker-based local developer environment proposal and supported application maintainability through debugging, refactoring, and code quality improvement.

**Expertise Leveraged:** application architecture, bug resolution, Docker-based development, modular software design

Points of Interest
- Identified an architecture problem with resize management and methodology used that effected the entire application and corrected it with a rewrite of that component.  
- Identified problem areas with architecture that by the design and implementation were excessively causing more bugs to be created and outlined a plan to quickly correct the problem areas.  
- Worked on team correcting bugs and making the application more stable.  
- Presented Docker solution for personal developer environments, testing and staging platform and on to production deployments.  
- Mentored junior programmers showing best practices and how to avoid getting into problems down the road by using sound practices.
- Diagnosed and resolved a critical architecture flaw in resize management, leading to a comprehensive rewrite that successfully eliminated over 40 open bugs and tasks, enhancing application stability.
- Implemented Docker-based personal developer environments, enhancing consistency with production settings and streamlining the development process.
- Engineered a modular architecture for a previously static application, achieving customization with less than 2% code modification, which facilitated client-specific feature development and generated new revenue streams.
- Guided junior developers in adopting industry best practices, resulting in a 30% reduction in technical debt and improved code quality.

**Tools Used:**  PHP 5.8 - 8.1, Python 2 - 3, Golang 1.21.3, PostgreSQL 16, SpannerDB, Redis, Jenkins, Github Actions, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, AWS (S3, SNS, SES, SQS), GCP (Pubsub, Cloud Storage, Compute Engine, GKE, SpannerDB, IAM, Event Arc), Jira, Confluence, Docker, DataDog, SonarCube, Fortify, Nexus IQ, OpenTelemetry, Grafana

Developed and deployed stand-alone services in Golang, Python, and PHP as part of a micro-services architecture. Migrated services from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and ensured system reliability through automated testing, performance monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines. 

**Expertise Leveraged:** Golang development, cloud infrastructure migration, microservices architecture

Points of Interest
- Built API’s and stand-alone services programmed in Golang, Python and PHP as part of a microservices architecture that utilizes message queues for communication
- Setup and configured services as part of the CI/CD pipeline that leveraged the following tools: Jenkins, Helm, Terraform, Make, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, SonarQube, Github actions, Fortify, Nexus IQ
- Setup and implemented performance metrics for services using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus and Grafana, as well as reporting to DataDog
- Mentored junior programmers using chat / video conference for quick question and pair programming more complex and deeper dives
- Achieved 99% uptime by enforcing 80 %+ test coverage, comprehensive integration testing, and automated verification using Fortify, Nexus IQ, and SonarQube.
- Increased system visibility by implementing real-time performance monitoring with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and DataDog across all active services.
- Enhanced legacy PHP application and Python backend services by implementing new features and resolving critical bugs, improving system stability and user satisfaction.
- Improved deployment reliability by configuring Docker-based test environments and CI/CD pipelines in Kubernetes using Helm, ensuring services passed automated tests pre-release.
- Enhanced system performance by redesigning architecture and database schemas, optimizing efficiency and reliability following the migration from AWS to GCP.
